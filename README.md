# Internal Medicine

Hello!

If you are visiting from ERAS, links for the projects discussed in the application were originally scheduled to populate on this page on October 1, 2019. Unfortunately, the write-ups are delayed pending further review due to potential errors noticed in the original data set from IPUMS. I've contacted them to see whether they can shed any further light and will be trying to find a workaround on my own in the meantime. This page will be updated when it's more clear that I'm on the right track!

In the meantime, please look through some R code that was written for one of the projects.

Thanks, Pritpal
