### Introduction

  - talk about heart failure in general: definition, classic clinical
    presentation, prevalence, associated morbidity and mortality, etc.

  - talk about how pharmacology is cornerstone of management; stress
    importance of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors / ARBs, and aldosterone
    antagonist, as they are only agents shown to decrease mortality

  - talk about general interest in seeing whether all heart failure
    patients are on BBs and ACEi/ARBs (as they should be, these drugs
    are indicated in all classes of heart failure); aldosterone
    antagonists are indicated in a specific subpopulation of heart
    failure patients so we don’t expect 100% take-up (can mention this
    “Discussion” under “limitations”)

  - talk about knowing about the degree of take-up of these medications
    can help us see whether HF is being managed appropriately at a
    population level; whether there are certain populations that are
    more likely to be managed sub-optimally. This knowledge is valuable
    because we can act upon it?
